# Description:

This repository contains Homework 1 for the Open-Source Energy System Modelling course.

The objective is to set up a new GitHub repository and gain hands-on experience with GitHub workflows.

The utils.py file provides three temperature conversion functions:

- celsius_to_fahrenheit – Converts a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
- fahrenheit_to_celsius – Converts a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius.
- celsius_to_kelvin – Converts a temperature from Celsius to Kelvin.

Each function is documented with a clear description of its purpose and usage.
